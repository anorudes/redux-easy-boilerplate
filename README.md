## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/anorudes/redux-easy-boilerplate.git
$ cd redux-easy-boilerplate
$ npm install
```

## Development
```
$ npm start
```
Runs the project in development mode with hot-reloading of `src` folder. 
Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Contribution

Before push commit make sure that all modules are added in package.json

### Try
```
$ rm -rf node_modules
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

## Clean
```
$ npm run clean
```
Using rimraf clean the `dist` folder, which is the target of the `build`

## Build & build:production
```
$ npm run build
```
Builds the app into the 'dist' folder for deployment 
```
$ npm run build:production
```
clean the `dist` folder and rebuilds the app for deployment
### Production
To run your server in production simply place the `index.html` and `dist` folder into
your `web root`.

In development mode the app uses `hashHistory` (e.g /#/home?_k=x928123) which
keeps track of your currently location on and the state of the page. It is adviced
for production to use `browserHistory` instead of `hashHistory`

To make this change edit `src/index.js`
```
// before change
...
import { Router, Redirect, hashHistory as history } from 'react-router'; 
...

// after change
...
import { Router, Redirect, browserHistory as history } from 'react-router';
...

```

the use of history push api requires that all your requests point to index.html
since react-router is keeping track of the navigation (e.g this can be done with `.htaccess` file at the web root or with `nginx` configuration)

## Run karma
```
$ npm test
```
## TODO
1. [ ] Write more tests!
2. [ ] Server-side rendering
